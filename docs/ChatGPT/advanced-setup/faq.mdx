## "Something went wrong" error

**Question**:

I've installed the ChatGPT plugin on a WordPress website, but the frontend users encounter a "Something Went Wrong" message. However, the logs indicate that a complete response was generated for that query. How can I resolve this problem?

**Answer**:

If you're using Nginx as your web server, please add the following lines to your Nginx configuration file:

```fastcgi_buffers 16 16k;```

```fastcgi_buffer_size 32k;```

Here are a couple of guides to assist you:
